# Text_Classification_model
### Description:
This repository contains the source code and implementation details for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model designed for text classification tasks. The model is trained to categorize text data into predefined classes.

### Features:
- Leverages the power of MLPs for robust text classification.
- Employs customizable architecture (number of layers, neurons) for adaptation to various datasets.
- Supports different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) for enhanced model flexibility.
- Well-structured code for clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility.
